## 🤝 How We Work
## 🔧 Collaboration & Optimization
- Strategic collaboration with hardware manufacturers, embedded software teams, and chip designers.  
- Integration- Middleware accelerates integration.Hardware Software Integration and Software Integration.  
- Offshore development + AI-assisted coding reduce SDLC costs.  
- OTA pipelines ensure **cost-effectiveness, scalability, and early failure detection**.
- Hands-on support to turn prototypes into deployable solutions.
- Helps to **scale quickly** by adapting Physical AI into existing environments.
- **Not intended to do R&D ourselves**, instead, mission is to help industries **maximize their R&D investments**.

This **ecosystem approach** allows us to evaluate cost-performance tradeoffs and deliver optimized, affordable solutions tailored to each use case.
